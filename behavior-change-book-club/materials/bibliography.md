## Bibliography

[Fostering Sustainable Behavior: Community-based Social Marketing][1]. Doug McKenzie-Mohr.
> This book provides a comprehensive introduction to community-based social marketing and how it is being applied throughout the world to foster sustainable behavior. It introduces the five steps of community-based social marketing (selecting behaviors, identifying barriers and benefits, developing strategies, conducting a pilot, and broad-scale implementation), and showcases numerous programs illustrating its use.

[World Development Report 2015: Mind, Society, and Behavior][2]. World Bank.
> This report aims to inspire and guide the researchers and practitioners who can help advance a new set of development approaches based on a fuller consideration of psychological and social influences. The title of this Report, Mind, Society, and Behavior, captures the idea that paying attention to how humans think (the processes of mind) and how history and context shape thinking (the influence of society) can improve the design and implementation of development policies and interventions that target human choice and action (behavior). 

[The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business][3]. Charles Duhigg.
> Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed. Distilling vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives that take us from the boardrooms of Procter & Gamble to sidelines of the NFL to the front lines of the civil rights movement, Duhigg presents a whole new understanding of human nature and its potential.

[Diffusion of Innovations (5th ed.)][4]. Everett M. Rogers.
> Everett M. Rogers explains how new ideas spread via communication channels over time. Such innovations are initially perceived as uncertain and even risky. To overcome this uncertainty, most people seek out others like themselves who have already adopted the new idea. Thus the diffusion process consists of a few individuals who first adopt an innovation, then spread the word among their circle of acquaintances—a process which typically takes months or years. But there are exceptions: use of the Internet in the 1990s, for example, may have spread more rapidly than any other innovation in the history of humankind. Furthermore, the Internet is changing the very nature of diffusion by decreasing the importance of physical distance between people.

[What We Think about When We Try Not to Think about Global Warming: Toward a New Psychology of Climate Action][7]. Per Espen Stokes.

> Why does knowing more mean believing and doing less? It is a catch-22 that starts, says psychologist and economist Per Espen Stoknes, from an inadequate understanding of the way most humans think, act, and live in the world around them. With dozens of examples from the private sector to government agencies Stoknes shows how to retell the story of climate change and, at the same time, create positive, meaningful actions that can be supported even by deniers.

[Who Rules the Earth? How Social Rules Shape our Planet and our Lives][6]. Paul F. Steinberg.

> Steinberg emphasizes the need to change the rules that guide human behavior and shape how we interact with the planet. Drawing together research findings from across the social sciences, the book helps readers to “see” the social rules that pattern our physical reality and shows why these are the big levers that will ultimately determine the prospects for sustainability. Social rules are humanly devised constraints that, like invisible threads, tug at us as we go about our daily lives and make coordinated social activity possible. We know them by familiar names like city ordinances, product design standards, purchasing agreements, public policies, cultural norms, or national constitutions.

[Wide Angle Lens][5]. Frameworks Institute.
> A highly visual, multimedia learning module that explores the difference between episodic and thematic storytelling. Grounded in scholarship, and filled with interactive features that build communicators’ ability to discern the frame effects of the storytelling choices common in media and advocacy, this course fosters skills in a key aspect of strategic framing. This resource is designed to help advocates distinguish between more and less effective ways of establishing a narrative that sets up policy thinking.

[Health Behavior and Health Education: Theory, Research, and Practice (4th Edition)][8]. Karen Glanz, Barbara Rimer, K Viswanath (Eds.) 2008. Ch 19 "Social Marketing" pp 453-461.
> This edition provides a comprehensive, highly accessible, and in-depth analysis of health behavior theories that are most relevant to health education. This essential resource includes the most current information on theory, research, and practice at individual, interpersonal, and community and group levels. This edition includes substantial new content on current and emerging theories of health communication, e-health, culturally diverse communities, health promotion, the impact of stress, the importance of networks and community, social marketing, and evaluation.

[The Psychology of Climate Change Communication: A Guide for Scientists, Journalists, Educators, Political Aides, and the Interested Public][9]. Center for Research Environmental Decisions.
> This guide combines laboratory and field research with real-world examples. It blends information from the broad spectrum of disciplines that CRED encompasses: psychology, anthropology, economics, history, environmental science and policy, and climate science. The guide’s purpose is to assist communicators in reaching two key audiences—the general public and decision makers from government and business—more effectively. The principles found in this guide should help make climate change presentations and discussions more effective.
